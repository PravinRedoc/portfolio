# [Research: Implementaion of TFIDF vectorizer from scratch]([https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj](https://github.com/PravinRedoc/Research/blob/main/TFIDF_Implementation.ipynb)) 
* Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency is the most popular text vectorization technique widely used in the text based analytics industry
* Implemented TFIDF vectorizer from scratch using numpy and pandas libraries.
* Deeper and Simple understanding of how TFIDF works internally.
* Comparision between actual library methods and implementation from scratch.


# [Research: Implementation of major Performation metrics used for Model Evaluation](https://github.com/PravinRedoc/Research/blob/main/Performance_metrics_Implementation.ipynb) 
* Implementaion of all the major and industry standard preformance metrics used to evaluate models such as confusion matrix, F1 score,AUC Score,MSE, MAPE, R^2
* Deeper understanding of how all these metrics work internally
* Comparision with sklearn metrics
